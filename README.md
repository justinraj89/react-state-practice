## React State Practice App

### This is a simple application with three different pages that all helped me further strenghthen my understanding of handling state with React. The first page allows you to select a state, and city, and recieve an image corresponding to your selection. The second page has a box in which you can click inside of and add points. This was super helpful in respect to further understanding the use of the spread operator. The third page is your trivial classic todo app, understanding how to filter items out of an array, and push items in is always good practice.

### On top of the Javascript/React practice, I also made sure this app was fully responsive, which was not hard with the help of Tailwind CSS.
